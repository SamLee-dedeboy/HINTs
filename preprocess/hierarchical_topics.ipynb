      "The article discussed the backlash against the Academy for not nominating any person of color in the main acting categories at the Oscars. Rev. Al Sharpton announced that he will hold a demonstration near the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles, and the National Action Network is organizing rallies in multiple cities. Twitter users expressed their disappointment using the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, specifically mentioning the snub of actors Will Smith for Concussion and Idris Elba for Beasts of No Nation.\n",
      "The article discussed how Pope Francis honored actors George Clooney and Richard Gere, as well as actress Salma Hayek, by awarding them the \"Olive Medal\" for peace at a Vatican event. The event was organized to promote the work of a foundation called Scholas Occurrentes, which aims to promote social integration and peace. It was not clear what the celebrities had done to merit the medals, but George Clooney is known for his activism and fundraising for the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n",
      "The article discussed Pope Francis greeting lead actor Joseph Fiennes and other members of the cast and production staff of the film Risen, which depicts the story of Jesus after the resurrection. Fiennes portrays a Roman tribune who oversees the execution of Jesus and is later assigned to investigate the theft of Jesus' body. The film aims to challenge viewers and bring believers and skeptics together in dialogue.\n",
      "The article discussed the confusion surrounding the splits between the Producers Guild of America, Screen Actors Guild, and Directors Guild of America in the Best Picture category at the Oscars. It predicted that \"Spotlight\" may be the least objectionable choice, but \"The Revenant\" could win due to the diversity crisis. It also mentioned potential winners such as Alejandro Iñárritu for Best Director and Leonardo DiCaprio for Best Actor in \"The Revenant,\" Brie Larson for her performance in \"Room,\" Sylvester Stallone for his role in \"Creed,\" and Alicia Vikander for \"The Danish Girl.\"\n",
      "The article discussed the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences apologizing for offensive jokes about Asians during the Oscars, prompted by a letter signed by Asian academy members. The apology was criticized as hollow by actor George Takei, who called the response from academy CEO Dawn Hudson \"patronizing\" and \"infuriating.\" The jokes and stereotypes perpetuated at the expense of Asians during the ceremony received swift backlash on social media.\n",
      "The article discussed Willow Smith's interview with Interview magazine, where she spoke about the issues of racism and unconscious cops in society. She also mentioned Anita Diamant's book, The Red Tent, which made her cry and reminded her of the tension between police and people of color. Jaden Smith also shared his thoughts on older people being \"mad\" about past events and wanting to move forward.\n",
      "The article discussed Chris Rock addressing Hollywood's diversity controversy at the 88th Academy Awards, where Leonardo DiCaprio won his first Best Actor Oscar for his role in \"The Revenant\" and the film \"Spotlight\" took home Best Picture. Rock joked about the lack of diversity in Hollywood and called for equal opportunities for black actors. The article also mentioned the film's producer, Steve Golin, addressing the Vatican and urging Pope Francis to protect children and restore faith in light of the film's subject matter.\n",
      "The article discussed how Chris Rock, the host of the Oscars, addressed the issue of lack of diversity in Hollywood. He made jokes about the lack of representation and mocked Jada Pinkett Smith for boycotting the event. Rock also highlighted the lack of interest in the nominated films among black moviegoers. Despite some uncomfortable moments, Rock's monologue brought attention to the issue of inclusiveness in the industry.\n",
      "The article discussed Will Smith and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith's decision to boycott the 88th Academy Awards due to the lack of diversity in the acting nominations. Smith expressed his support for his wife's call to action and emphasized the importance of diversity in Hollywood and America. Other celebrities, including Spike Lee, Michael Moore, Tyrese Gibson, and Snoop Dogg, have also pledged to boycott the awards show.\n",
      "The article discussed the 88th annual Academy Award nominations, with The Revenant receiving the most nominations with 12, followed by Mad Max: Fury Road with 10. The nominations included films such as Brooklyn, The Martian, and Spotlight, and actors such as Cate Blanchett, Brie Larson, and Leonardo DiCaprio. The Oscars will recognize achievements in 24 categories, including Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay.\n"
