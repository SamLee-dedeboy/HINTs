    "Warehouse managers can be aware of delayed orders through intuitive monitoring. \n",
    "However, the warehouse faces rapidly incoming orders from online users in real time, which brings an uncertain workload to monitoring the status of order processing. \n",
    "Moreover, the streaming data of order processing in e-commerce warehouses have complex features. \n",
    "First, orders have hierarchy data structures. \n",
    "For example, one order can include multiple stock keeping units (SKUs) to pick and a few packages to pack. \n",
    "Second, different orders are processed simultaneously in parallel operation stations. \n",
    "These features bring challenges to the existing visual analytics approach [target] on monitoring assembly lines in smart factories, which has limitations in presenting parallel tasks and hierarchy data structures. \n",

    "Following the nine-stage design study methodology proposed by Sedl- mair et al. [target], we collaborated closely with two warehousing experts from a large e-commerce corporation. Both of them have worked in e-commerce warehousing for more than four years. Specifically, the col- laboration started with characterizing domain problems for e-commerce warehouses in the Precondition Phase. We iteratively experienced the Learn and Winnow stages at this phase, in which we arranged multiple interviews with experts, conducted field inspections at collaborated warehouses, and surveyed related literature and commercial applica- tions. Initial requirements were derived to monitor order processing status and solve delayed orders. Then, in the Core Phase, we held weekly meetings for four months with each other to discover specific requirements and tasks, and design prototypes to collect experts’ feed- back for improvements. The final requirements and visual design were derived in the iterative user-centric procedure including interviewing, observing, brainstorming, designing, and prototyping. We formulate design requirements in three aspects, namely, monitoring, analyzing, and evaluating delayed orders.\n",

    "The previous studies about manufacturing process visualization [29, 68] are highly related to our work. \n",
    "However, these studies assume that the dealing workload and producing schedule are stable. \n",
    "The situa- tion in e-commerce warehousing is different because the individual at- tributes (such as order SKUs) of online orders are unpredictable, which brings an uncertain processing workload. \n",
    "These uncertain workloads further result in a dynamic producing schedule due to specific order- picking operational strategies [11]. \n",
    "All these uncertainties make it hard to directly judge delaying events based on the spent time interval [29] and the proposed time-aware outlier-preserving visual aggregation tech- nique [68]. \n",
    "Inspired by these studies, we propose new visual designs and develop a novel system for monitoring, analyzing, and evaluating order delaying issues in e-commerce warehouses.\n",
