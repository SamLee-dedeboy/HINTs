      "Article 1: \n",
      "The article discussed the U.S. military's withdrawal of personnel from Saudi Arabia who were coordinating with the air campaign in Yemen, reducing Washington's involvement in advising a campaign that has caused civilian casualties. The Pentagon acknowledged concerns about the conflict and expressed the need to minimize civilian casualties. Additionally, the article mentioned the attack on a hospital operated by Medecins Sans Frontieres in Yemen, which led to the evacuation of staff and raised concerns about arms transfers to Saudi Arabia. In another news, government supporters in Venezuela attacked and besieged lawmakers in the country's congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 2: \n",
      "The article discussed the White House's immediate review of Washington's support for the Arab campaign against Yemen's Houthis after an air strike on a funeral gathering, which killed 140 people. The attack poses more trouble for the coalition and indirectly hands a propaganda win to Tehran, a Houthi ally. The article also mentioned Donald Trump's upcoming meeting with eastern NATO allies in Warsaw, where he is expected to reaffirm Washington's commitment to counter threats from Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 3: \n",
      "The article discussed a suicide bombing in Aden, Yemen, claimed by ISIS, which killed at least 52 soldiers and injured 34 others. The attack targeted the Al Solban military base where soldiers were lining up to receive their salaries. Aden, the capital of the Yemeni government, has been under the control of Houthi rebels, and Yemen has become a proxy battleground for Saudi Arabia and Iran, with ongoing conflicts involving various groups including Al Qaeda and ISIS.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 4: \n",
      "The article discussed how U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in talks with Gulf Arab states and the United Nations in Saudi Arabia, agreed on a plan to restart peace talks in Yemen with the goal of forming a unity government. Kerry stated that the conflict in Yemen had gone on for too long and needed to end, and proposed that the Houthis cease shelling across the border with Saudi Arabia, pull back from the capital Sanaa, cede their weapons, and enter into a unity government with their domestic foes. The article also mentioned the criticism faced by Saudi Arabia for civilian casualties in Yemen and the attack on Venezuela's congress by government supporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 5: \n",
      "The article discussed Qatar's contribution of 1,000 new homes for Palestinians affected by the 2014 Gaza war, which has helped Hamas and irked Israel and the U.S. Qatar has also provided funding for the construction of a new hospital in Gaza. In other news, Turkish military preparations in northwest Syria are seen as legitimate measures against Kurdish forces, and President Donald Trump will have the opportunity to improve relations with NATO allies during his upcoming meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 6: \n",
      "The article discussed how the Pentagon has revised its Law of War guidelines to clarify that journalists are civilians and should be protected as such. The changes were made in response to concerns raised by news organizations, including the Associated Press, about vaguely worded provisions that could be interpreted as allowing commanders to detain journalists. The revised manual also explicitly states that engaging in journalism does not constitute taking a direct part in hostilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 7: \n",
      "The article discussed the arrival of Japanese peacekeepers in South Sudan, marking the first time in almost 70 years that Japanese troops have been authorized to use force. The 130 Ground Self-Defense Force troops will take over from the current group of peacekeepers and have a mandate to defend people, including aid workers, but not engage with opposing armies. The deployment has been controversial in Japan, with concerns about being drawn into a complex conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 8: \n",
      "The article discussed the ceasefire in Yemen's civil war, which was declared by the military coalition and aimed at ending the conflict. However, fighting and air strikes were still reported in some parts of the country, straining the ceasefire. The Yemeni government and the Houthis blamed each other for the fighting in Taiz, while the Saudi general accused the Houthis of launching a ballistic missile in violation of the ceasefire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 9: \n",
      "The article discussed Rep. Robert Pittenger's trip to South America to assess the potential funding of terrorist groups in the region. He expressed concern about the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) being the largest terrorism funding organization in the world, as well as the expansion of Hezbollah's presence through Venezuela, Argentina, and Ecuador. Pittenger also highlighted Iran's involvement in the region and its close relationship with former Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 10: \n",
      "The article discussed the renewed fighting in South Sudan's capital Juba between troops loyal to President Salva Kiir and soldiers who support Riek Machar, raising fears of a return to civil war. The United Nations called for an end to the fighting and urged both sides to fully implement the peace agreement. The violence has resulted in the death of over 300 people, including civilians and a Chinese peacekeeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 11: \n",
      "The article discussed the signing of a new peace agreement between Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and Rodrigo Londono, the leader of FARC, despite opposition from former President Alvaro Uribe. The new accord, which introduces several changes to address critics' concerns, will not be put to a vote but will go to Colombia's Congress for ratification. However, the lack of unified support for the peace deal could complicate the process of disarming fighters and implementing the terms of the agreement.\n",

      "Article 12: \n",
      "The article discussed how the Yemeni government suspended peace talks after the Houthi movement seized a military base, killing several soldiers. The government's top delegate to the negotiations stated that the talks had been \"torpedoed\" by the Houthi assault. In other news, a Venezuelan police officer who staged a helicopter attack on government buildings vowed to continue fighting for the \"liberation\" of his country.\n",

      "Article 13: \n",
      "The article discussed how veterans of Colombia's FARC guerrilla army may soon have the opportunity to work in economic projects such as being guides, beef processors, or cheese makers. These projects, funded by the FARC, aim to provide jobs for former fighters and prevent them from turning to illegal activities. The peace agreement between President Juan Manuel Santos and rebel leader Timochenko is expected to be approved in a public vote on October 2nd.\n",

      "\n",
      "Article 14: \n",
      "The article discussed the personal rivalry between Alvaro Uribe and Juan Manuel Santos, as Uribe successfully led the campaign against the peace deal with FARC, dealing a blow to Santos' government and putting himself in a strong position for the 2018 presidential election. Uribe criticized the peace deal for being too lenient on rebel leaders and mobilized millions of Colombians against it. Santos now needs Uribe's support to put the peace process back on track.\n",

      "Article 15: \n",
      "The article discussed a failed missile attack on the U.S. Navy guided missile destroyer, USS Mason, by Houthi rebels in Yemen. The attack comes after a United Arab Emirates vessel was also targeted by the rebels, highlighting the growing risks to the U.S. military in Yemen's conflict. The U.S. government has announced a review of its support to the Saudi coalition battling the Houthis after a strike on mourners in Sanaa.\n",

      "Article 16: \n",
      "The article discussed the potential end to the war between the Colombian government and the FARC rebel group, a conflict that has lasted for over five decades and claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Last week, the government and the FARC announced that they have agreed upon the key terms of a peace agreement, and this week, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a mission to help monitor and verify the process of laying down arms. If all goes as planned, this long and devastating war may finally come to an end.\n",

      "Article 17: \n",
      "The article discussed how forces aligned with Yemen's internationally recognized government, with support from the coalition dominated by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, launched a major offensive to drive out militants aligned with AQAP from their strongholds in the south. This marks a shift in the coalition's focus, as they had previously targeted the Houthi rebels. The offensive comes amid recently restarted peace talks and concerns about the empowerment of AQAP due to Saudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen.\n",

      "Article 18: \n",
      "The article discussed how the U.S. Navy intercepted an Iranian vessel in the Arabian Sea and confiscated over 2,000 weapons that were believed to be destined for the Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen. This seizure comes just days after a ceasefire agreement was reached between the warring parties in Yemen. The weapons were assessed to have originated in Iran, which has been accused by Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies of violating the United Nations arms embargo against the Houthis.\n",

      "Article 19: \n",
      "The article discussed the signing of a revised peace accord between the Colombian government and the FARC rebel group, after the original deal was rejected by Colombian voters in October. The new agreement includes reparations for victims, the formation of a political party by FARC, and the establishment of transitional areas for rehabilitation. US Secretary of State John Kerry and US National Security Adviser Susan Rice praised the Colombian government for achieving the revised peace agreement.\n",
