Sensemaking on large collections of text is a challenging task that analysts have to perform.
Previous works approach this problem either from a topic- or entity-based perspective, but they lack interpretability and trust.
In this paper, we propose a visual analytics system that allow analysts to explore and reorganize a corpus to suit their needs and quickly make sense of the 4Ws from the organized corpus.
The system first organizes a large corpus into a hypergraph by combining topic- and entity-based extraction techniques.
Then the hypergraph is hierarchically clustered and visualized for analysts to explore and reorganize interactively. 
Finally, an event graph visualization method based on storyline enables analysts to quickly make sense of the 4Ws.
The whole pipeline is designed to foster interpretability and trust by providing semantic context of the visualization and by supporting curating interactions.
Case studies and a task-based evaluation are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and trustworthiness of the system.

Our contributions are:
1. A technique that organizes a large corpus into a hypergraph by combining topic- and entity-based extraction by utilizing the power of LLM. 
2. A scalable SFC-based hierarchical hypergraph visualization method and interaction techniques that supports user to explore and reorganize the corpus to suit their needs. (by searching, semantic zooming and filtering)
3. A storyline-based event graph visualization method that enables user to quickly make sense of the 4Ws from large collection of documents.
4?. Lessons learned for designing interpretable and trustworthy AI-enabled text analysis system.

Task-based evaluation:
1. Explore and reorganize the corpus according to a provided topic (e.g. election)
- What are other topics that you are filtering out?
- What are the sub-topics for the provided topic?

2. Answer questions about the 4Ws:
- Who were the main participants?
- Give a summary of what happened between the main participants
- What insight do you gain?

TODO:
- Overview
    1. Outer layer for entities (using SFC)
    2. Add dragging & merging clusters
    3. Add search upon search
- Storyline Vis

Treemap-based SFC? (previous KL paper)


1. entity and article region needs to be more obvious 
2. highlight on hovering labels

paper writing
1. motivation: highlight existing works and their limitations

2. future work: record change logs

TODO:
1. Show current topic structure when not hovered
2. Improve tooltip layout
3. automatically find most appropriate level (bottom up)
