      "         'in the sense that like Palm Beach, Miami-Dade completed a portion of '\n",

      "         'continue with a manual recount. So not only did it never finish, but '\n",
      "         'it intentionally stopped the manual recount. Second, unlike Palm '\n",
      "         'Beach, Miami-Dade did not certify its partial results. Neither of '\n",
      "         'those distinctions, we believe, make a difference at this stage, '\n",
      "         'that is, the election contest stage, because again, the issue before '\n",
      "         'the court is: Is there or are there legal votes that have been '\n",

      "         'recount were or were not certified, those are still legal votes that '\n",
      "         'should be considered in this election contest. So that the fact that '\n",
      "         'those votes exist is what is important, not whether or not they were '\n",
      "         'certified, and not even whether or not they should have been '\n",
      "         'certified. The second issue with respect to Miami-Dade are the '\n",

      "         'even once. With respect to Broward County and Palm Beach County, all '\n",
