%% Abstract section.
\abstract{%
Sensemaking on large collections of documents (corpus) is a challenging task that analysts often have to perform.
Previous works approach this problem either from a topic- or entity-based perspective, but they lack interpretability and trust due to poor model alignment.
In this paper, we propose HyperMap, a visual analytics approach that combines topic- and entity-based techniques seamlessly.
By leveraging the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), we model the corpus as a hypergraph that matches the user's mental model when analyzing a corpus.
The hypergraph is then hierarchically clustered with an agglomerative clustering algorithm by combining semantic and connectivity similarity.
The system is designed to emphasize Model Alignment to foster interpretability and trust.
To demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of the HyperMap system, we present two case studies on two different datasets: a news article dataset and a visualization publication dataset.
We discuss limitations and future work of combining visualization and LLMs to enhance analysts' ability to analyze a corpus.
