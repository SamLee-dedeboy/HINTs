%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
Sensemaking on large collections of unstructured text (corpus) is a challenging task that analysts have to perform.
Previous works approach this problem either from a topic- or entity-based perspective, but they lack interpretability and trust.
In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach that combines topic- and entity-based techniques seamlessly by modeling the corpus as a hypergraph.
The hypergraph is then hierarchically clustered with an agglomerative clustering algorithm by combining semantic and connectivity similarity.
We visualize the clustering result to allow analysts to explore and reorganize a corpus for their analysis.
The system is designed to foster interpretability and trust by providing rich semantic context for the visualization and by supporting curating interactions.
Case studies and a task-based evaluation are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and trustworthiness of the system.
