\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose HyperMap, a visual analytics system that assists users in exploring, reorganizing and analyzing a corpus.
Previous works have shown that topic- and entity-based analysis are essential to sensemaking on a corpus,
but existing text analysis tools do not provide a unified interface for both types of analysis.
We fill in this gap by combining state-of-the-art large language models and hypergraph analysis and visualization techniques.
We introduce an LLM-based pipeline to extract topics and characters from unstructured text documents.
We model the corpus as hypergraphs and apply an agglomerative clustering algorithm.
The clusters are visualized by building upon existing space-filling curve layouts, which exhibit a high level of visual scalability and aesthetics.
Moreover, we emphasize the importance of Model Alignment in the design of visual analytics systems.
The generalizability and effectiveness of HyperMap are demonstrated in two case studies, analyzing datasets from two different domains.
Our future research aims to utilize the capabilities of LLMs to understand user intent to support more advanced analysis tasks.
