\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Preprocessing}
The Methodology can work for any unstructured dataset
\subsubsection{Summarization}
Chatgpt for summarization
\subsubsection{Document Embedding}
OpenAI's embedding API
\subsubsection{Major Participant Extraction}
Chatgpt for major participant extraction and another model for entity linking

\subsection{Modeling}
\subsubsection{Hierarchical HyperGraph Clustering}
We organize the data into a hypergraph: nodes, hyperedges.

The hypergraph is clustered based on semantic and connectivity similarity: dual, Ravasz algorithm

Chatgpt to assign topics to each cluster
