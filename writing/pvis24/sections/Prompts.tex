\section{Chat Responses for usage scenario 2}
\quad \textit{Q: } Given the selected documents, what should I consider when designing text visualization?

\textit{A: }
When designing text visualization, here are some key considerations based on the selected articles:\\
When designing text visualization, you should consider the following aspects based on the selected articles: \\
1. Amount of text: Determine the appropriate amount of text to include in the visualization. The articles suggest that adding text annotations to visualizations can enhance understanding and should not be penalized. Participants preferred charts with more textual annotations over charts with fewer annotations or text alone. \\
2. Semantic content: Consider the type of information conveyed by the text. Text that describes statistical or relational components of a chart leads to more takeaways referring to statistics or relational comparisons. \\
3. Placement of text: Text should be placed strategically within the visualization. Different kinds of information are best placed in the title or closer to the data, depending on the semantic level. \\
4. Integration of text and charts: Aim for a tight coupling between text and charts to support the synthesis of information. Investigate ways to establish interactive references between text and charts, allowing users to construct connections effortlessly. \\
5. Real-time analysis: If dealing with real-time data, consider the scalability and adaptiveness of the visualization. Develop interactive systems that enable visual analysis of streaming social media data or dynamically cluster posts related to relevant topics. \\
6. Support for specific tasks: Tailor the visualization to specific tasks such as clinical chart review, argument structure analysis, or anomaly detection in social media. Incorporate insights from domain experts and conduct iterative design processes to ensure usability. \\
7. Enhancement of comprehension: Explore techniques that facilitate enhanced comprehension of complex documents by coupling text content with data visualizations. Generate on-demand visualizations based on the reader's focus within the document and evaluate their effectiveness against traditional reading experiences. \\
8. Customizability and integration with existing workflows: Provide tools that are customizable to the needs of users, such as healthcare providers and physicians, while preserving and extensively linking to the original text. Avoid obscuring or substituting the original clinical text that contains qualitative and rhetorical flavors. \\
9. Facilitating analysis of complex textual differences: Develop visual analytics environments that support the alignment of complex textual differences, prevailing in medieval text traditions or other literature domains. Provide interactive visualizations for investigating repetition, variance, and other textual hierarchies. \\
10. Evaluation and validation: Perform user studies, expert reviews, and evaluations to validate the effectiveness and utility of the visualization techniques. Collect feedback from users and iterate designs based on their needs and preferences. Consider these guidelines when designing text visualizations to ensure effective communication and comprehension of information.\\

\textit{Q: } Given the selected documents, what is considered a balanced ratio of text and charts?

\textit{A: }
Based on the selected article, it is suggested that a balanced ratio of text and charts can vary depending on the context and purpose of the visualization. 
The article mentions that heavily annotated charts were not penalized and participants preferred charts with more textual annotations. 
However, it also emphasizes the importance of considering the qualitative properties and placement of the text within the chart. 
Overall, it is recommended to use a combination of text and charts that provides additional context, guidance, and relevant information to the readers without overwhelming or distracting them from the visualizations.

\section{Agglomerative Clustering}
The algorithm takes a hypergraph $H=(V, E)$ and the embeddings of each node $Vec$ as input, and outputs a sequence of partitions $P=P_1, P_2, \dots P_k$.
Each partition corresponds to a level in the hierarchy.
